# Metrolens AR
## A visualizer for the world around you 
Metrolens AR is a native IOS application written using SwiftUI and Combine framework that aims to help people travelling or commuting discover their city in an AR environment. 

My goal for this application was to allow the users to easily navigate the city they want to explore, with a simple and intuitive UI/UX experience by harvnessing the native power of ARKit.

## Backend
The content is served using a Django/ GraphQL API. The repository of the project can be found here:
