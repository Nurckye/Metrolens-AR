Metrolens AR is a native IOS application written using SwiftUI and Combine framework that aims to help people travelling or commuting discover their city in an AR environment. 

My goal for this application was to allow the users to easily navigate the city they want to explore, with a simple and intuitive UI/UX experience by harnessing the native power of ARKit.
